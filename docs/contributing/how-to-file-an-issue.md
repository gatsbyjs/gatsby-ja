The [問題追跡](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues) バグレポート、機能リクエスト、および [submitting pull requests](/contributing/how-to-open-a-pull-request/).

If you want your Issue to be resolved quickly, please include in your Issue:

- Gatsby version, Node.js version, OS version
- The contents of your `gatsby-config.js` and `package.json` as well as your
  `gatsby-node.js`, `gatsby-browser.js` `gatsby-ssr.js` files depending on
  changes you've made there.

Please do not use the Issue tracker for personal support requests. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=gatsby) (**gatsby** tag) and the [Gatsby Discord](https://gatsby.dev/discord) are better places to get help.

### Special Note on Issues

If an Issue is affecting you, start at the top of this list and complete as many tasks on the list as you can:

1.  If there is an Issue, add a reaction or more details to the Issue to indicate that it's affecting you
2.  If there is an Issue and you can add more detail, write a comment describing how the bug is affecting OR if you can, write up a work-around for the bug
3.  If there _is not_ an Issue, write the most complete description of what's happening, preferably with link to a Gatsby site that reproduces the problem or [create a reproducible test case](/contributing/how-to-make-a-reproducible-test-case/)
4.  Offer to help fix the bug (and it is totally expected that you ask for help; open-source maintainers want to help contributors)
5.  [Deliver a well-crafted, tested PR](/contributing/how-to-open-a-pull-request/)
