title: Using GraphQL Fragments
---

Fragments allow you to reuse parts of GraphQL queries. It also allows you to split up complex queries into smaller, easier to understand components.

## The building blocks of a fragment

Here is an example fragment:

```graphql
fragment FragmentName on TypeName {
  field1
  field2
}
```

A fragment consists of three components:

1. `FragmentName`: the name of the fragment that will be referenced later.
2. `TypeName`: the [GraphQL type](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/object-types/) of the object the fragment will be used on. This is important because you can only query for fields that actually exist on a given object.
3. The body of the query. You can define any fields with any level of nesting in here, the same that you would elsewhere in a GraphQL query

## Creating and using a fragment

A fragment can be created inside any GraphQL query, but it's good practice to create the query separately. More organization advice in the [Conceptual Guide](/docs/graphql-concepts/#fragments).

```jsx:title=src/components/IndexPost.jsx
import React from "react"
import { graphql } from "gatsby"

export default ( props ) => {
  return (...)
}

export const query = graphql`
  fragment SiteInformation on Site {
    siteMetadata {
      title
      siteDescription
    }
  }
`
```

This defines a fragment named `SiteInformation`. Now it can be used from within the page's GraphQL query:

```jsx:title=src/pages/main.jsx
import React from "react"
import { graphql } from "gatsby"
import IndexPost from "../components/IndexPost"

export default ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.site.siteMetadata.title}</h1>
      <p>{data.site.siteMetadata.siteDescription}</p>

      {/*
        Or you can pass all the data from the fragment
        back to the component that defined it
      */}
      <IndexPost siteInformation={data.site.siteMetadata} />
    </div>
  )
}

export const query = graphql`
  query {
    site {
      ...SiteInformation
    }
  }
`
```

When compiling your site, Gatsby preprocesses all GraphQL queries it finds. Therefore, any file that gets included in your project can define a snippet. However, only Pages can define GraphQL queries that actually return data. This is why you can define the fragment in the component file - it doesn't actually return any data directly.
